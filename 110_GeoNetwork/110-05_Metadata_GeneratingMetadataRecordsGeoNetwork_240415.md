**Purpose:**



The goal of this process is to provide a guide to standardize metadata records in the SGDC. The desired thumbnail and any desired data files should already be available.Â  If a link to a GeoServer WMS map is desired, this should also be in place.Â

| 8 | Data transfer option section is optional but desirable.Â  Best to do this after loading into GeoNetwork.Â  As protocols, use: | There are many other protocols.Â  These three options are very common: |
|  |  |  |
|  | - For web address: | - Use an external web hyperlink to provide more information, or to link to a data provider site for added acknowledgement |
|  |  |  |
|  | WWW:LINK-1.0-http---link | - Use the download link to provide dataset(s) |
|  |  |  |
|  | - For file download: | - Use the map protocol for local map display of data featuresÂ  and for Google Map display |
|  |  |  |
|  | WWW:DOWNLOAD-1.0-http---download |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | - For OGC Web Map Service (ver 1.1.1): |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map |  |
| 9 | Spatial Extent and Temporal Extent | - Add a "Geographic bounding box" and draw the spatial extent that best fits the metadata record |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Make sure to include "Temporal Extent" with date range or date of documents/project. Make sure publication date is there too. |
| 10 | Add files to record following this naming convention: "Year_Site_Title" | - If the file is internal to PSF: |
