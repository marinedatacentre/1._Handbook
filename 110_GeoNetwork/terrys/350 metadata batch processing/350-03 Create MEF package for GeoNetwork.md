**Purpose:**

This document describes how to create a metadata exchange format (mef)
package for loading groups of metadata with accompanying files into
GeoNetwork. There is sufficient detail required for the graphic overview
and data files being added into the mef that it is best constructed
programmatically.

Each metadata set in the mef package consists of a metadata record,
optional graphics files, optional data files, and an "info.xml" document
describing the package contents. It uses a custom python application
(305-F05).
