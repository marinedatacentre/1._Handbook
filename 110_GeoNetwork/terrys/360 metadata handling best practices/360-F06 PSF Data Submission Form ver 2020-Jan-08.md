**Data Submission Form**



In the following, "data" includes datasets, geo-referenced maps and figures (such as may be found in reports), videotapes with scientific content, and databases. Don't repeat phone or email detail if the same.



Are there existing metadata that describe the data?

**[General Guidance]{.underline}**



**NOTE: [only one set of full contact information]{.underline} is needed, ever. For other contact information in this or any other PSF metadata records, only the contact name is required.**



For all metadata, there are about a dozen common sense required items:



1.  **title** - preferably 10-20 words (can be longer) and formatted as a result-oriented statement, some indication of location, and some indication of date or date range.  e.g.  water property observations in Howe Sound, 2015-2019



2.  **abstract** - the \'what\' the dataset is



3.  **purpose** (optional) - the \'why\' the data was originally gathered or project undertaken



4.  **supplemental** information (optional) -- a "catch all" - other information that may be usefully included, and not provided in other sections of the metadata record.



5.  **publication date** of the metadata (not of a  research paper)



6.  **principal investigator**, with contact info (can be multiple PIs)



7.  **geographic bounding box** (N, S, E, W) - great precision not required.



8.  **date** or more commonly date-range (start-stop) of the data.  Can include time if relevant.



9.  **credit** - identify the team members involved in the project, if relevant and desired



10. **point of contact** info, if different from the PI



11. **status** - completed, in progress, under development (ie, can do metadata before gathering data), \....



12. **metadata creator** contact info - can be the same as the PI, or different



13. **access or usage constraints** - we routinely put in something like \'intellectual property rights\' (to request credit for the PIs).  An extreme condition could be \'contact the PI for data access\'.  Note these are requests; once data is released, realistically no one can control it.  However, no scientific user would willfully violate or abuse conditions for fear of a damaged reputation.



14. **distributor** contact info - normally PSF, if we distribute online.  Need not be PSF, if wish some other approach.  Can be multiple distributors.  If PSF, we can complete this item.



15. **the data**, in some format.  Can be a number of items.  Can be a hyperlink to data.  Can include journal papers, or references thereto.  Often a spreadsheet Every time should clearly indicate time zone .



16. optional : **organization website hyperlink** - so we can give full credit to the data provider



17. optional: a small jpeg image (**thumbnail**) - of the data, or the area



18. optional: **lineage** - all processing steps taken to create the present product, starting with acquisition (date, individuals, step description, equipment used).  Especially for non-profit and citsci organizations, this adds credibility to the data if one can describe the care and controls used during acquisition and handling.



Gathering and organizing the above information is normally what takes time; creating a metadata record from the information takes perhaps 30 minutes.  After the record is created, it is internationally-portable to any standards-compliant metadata server. This means that for this dataset the documentation may never need to be done again.
