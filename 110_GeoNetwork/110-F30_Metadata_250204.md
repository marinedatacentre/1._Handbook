**Purpose:**

This document describes the role of metadata and how GeoNetwork supports its creation and management within the PSF Marine Data Centre. Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, and makes datasets easier to find and use. In the context of the PSF Marine Data Centre, metadata ensures that marine and environmental datasets are well-documented, discoverable, and accessible to researchers, policymakers, and conservation groups, as we aim to be a “one-stop-shop” for marine information.  
  
**What is Metadata?**  
Metadata provides essential details about datasets, including:

- **Data source and authorship:** Who created the dataset and when.

- **Usage rights and licensing:** Any restrictions on data access and reuse.

- **Spatial and temporal coverage:** Where and when the data was collected.

- **Keywords and thematic categories:** How the data is classified for discovery.

- **Formats and standards:** The technical specifications and structure of the dataset.  
    
  By maintaining consistent metadata, the PSF Marine Data Centre ensures that datasets can be effectively searched, understood, and reused by multiple users.  
    
  **How GeoNetwork Supports Metadata Management in the PSF Marine Data Centre**  
  GeoNetwork is an open-source catalog application that facilitates metadata creation, management, and dissemination. It follows international standards such as ISO 19115 and Dublin Core, ensuring interoperability between different data providers.  
    
  **Key Metadata Functions in GeoNetwork:**

- **Metadata Search and Discovery:** Users can perform metadata searches across multiple catalogs, leveraging full-text indexing and structured queries to locate relevant marine datasets.

- **Metadata Editing and Validation:** GeoNetwork supports multilingual metadata editing with built-in validation tools to enhance metadata quality and compliance with standards. This ensures that PSF Marine Data Centre records meet industry best practices.

- **Geopublication and Sharing:** Metadata records can be linked with spatial datasets, enabling their publication through OGC services (e.g., WMS, WMTS, WFS) for seamless data sharing among researchers and marine resource managers.

- **Metadata Quality Enhancement:** The system suggests improvements for metadata completeness, ensuring better data documentation and usability. This enhances the reliability of data used in environmental assessments and decision-making.

- **Monitoring and Reporting:** Administrators can generate usage statistics and quality reports on metadata records to assess system performance and engagement within the PSF Marine Data Centre.
