**Purpose:**

This set of documents explains how to prepare images and data for loading metadata packages in batch.

The process expects the thumbnail images and metadata have been created by processes 305-01 and 305-03, and data has been loaded into a GeoServer database (process 305-04) and styled as a GeoServer layer (process 305-05).

The process is intended for an advanced audience, and requires some commercial applications and basic programming expertise.
