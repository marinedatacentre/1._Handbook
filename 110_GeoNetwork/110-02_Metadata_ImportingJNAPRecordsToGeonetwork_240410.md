**Purpose:**



This document describes the process of uploading a metadata record created in jNAP to GeoNetwork in the Strait of Georgia Data Centre's interface. This process is a general process that will likely NOT apply to every single record contained within the SGDC. If in doubt, ask a SGDC elder (Ben + Terry) for advice.
