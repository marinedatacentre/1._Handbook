**Purpose:**

This document describes the process of uploading a metadata record
created in jNAP to GeoNetwork in the Strait of Georgia Data Centre's
interface. This process is a general process that will likely NOT apply
to every single record contained within the SGDC. If in doubt, ask a
SGDC elder (Ben + Terry) for advice.
