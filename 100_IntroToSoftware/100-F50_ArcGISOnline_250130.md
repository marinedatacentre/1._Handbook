**Purpose:**

This document describes the basic functionality of ArcGIS Online and how
it fits within the Data Centre's processes. ArcGIS Online is Esri's
cloud-based GIS platform that allows users to create, analyze, and share
spatial data through interactive maps, dashboards, and applications. It
provides an accessible and collaborative environment for managing
geospatial information without the need for local software installation.

ArcGIS Online supports various data formats, including vector, raster,
and real-time feeds, and integrates with other Esri products like ArcGIS
Pro, ArcGIS Hub, and Story Maps. It enables users to perform spatial
analysis, create web maps and apps, and publish datasets as hosted
feature layers. The platform also includes tools for data visualization,
geoprocessing, and sharing within secured groups or publicly.

**Key Features:**

- **Web-based mapping & visualization** -- Create and share interactive
  web maps.

- **Hosted data services** -- Store, manage, and publish spatial data in
  the cloud.

- **Spatial analysis tools** -- Perform buffer, overlay, and proximity
  analyses.

- **Integration with Esri ecosystem** -- Connect with ArcGIS Pro,
  Dashboards, and StoryMaps.

- **Collaboration & sharing** -- Manage access and permissions for
  groups or public users.
