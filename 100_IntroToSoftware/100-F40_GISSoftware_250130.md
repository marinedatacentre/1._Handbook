**Purpose:**

This document describes the basic functionality of GIS software and how it fits within the Data Centre's processes. GIS (Geographic Information System) software is used for capturing, managing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. It allows users to create, edit, and share geospatial information, supporting decision-making in various domains such as environmental management, urban planning, and conservation.

We utilize a combination of open-source (QGIS), proprietary (Esri ArcGIS), and web-based solutions to enhance spatial data accessibility and analysis for various projects at PSF. QGIS is a free, open-source GIS that provides advanced spatial analysis tools and integration with multiple data formats. Esri's ArcGIS suite offers comprehensive GIS capabilities, including cloud-based collaboration, 3D visualization, and real-time data processing.

Each GIS software enables spatial data manipulation through various functions such as georeferencing, cartographic rendering, geostatistical analysis, and integration with web services (e.g., WMS, WFS). Additionally, GIS platforms facilitate metadata management and interoperability with other systems like GeoNetwork for cataloging spatial datasets.

**Key Features:**

- Data visualization & mapping -- Create and customize interactive maps.

- Spatial analysis -- Perform proximity, overlay, and statistical analyses.

- Remote sensing support -- Process satellite and aerial imagery.

- Data integration -- Connect with databases, web services, and real-time feeds.

- Metadata management -- Ensure data quality and interoperability.
