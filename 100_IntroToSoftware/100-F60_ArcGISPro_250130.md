**Purpose:**

This document describes the basic functionality of ArcGIS Pro and how it fits within the Data Centre's processes. ArcGIS Pro is Esri's desktop GIS software, designed for advanced spatial data analysis, cartography, and geoprocessing. It provides a modern, 64-bit environment with support for 2D and 3D visualization, seamless integration with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise, and powerful automation capabilities through Python and ModelBuilder.

ArcGIS Pro enables users to work with multiple map layouts, conduct geospatial analysis, and edit data across various formats, including shapefiles, geodatabases, and real-time services. Its integration with cloud-based and enterprise GIS systems ensures smooth collaboration and data sharing. The software also supports scripting and automation using Python, allowing for efficient workflows and large-scale processing. We normally use this software to produce maps that are normally used in reports, newsletters, or specific projects.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-format data support -- Work with raster, vector, and real-time data.

- 2D & 3D visualization -- Create high-quality maps and 3D scenes.

- Advanced geoprocessing -- Perform spatial analysis and modeling.

- Integration with ArcGIS Online & Enterprise -- Sync and publish data easily.

- Automation & scripting -- Use Python and ModelBuilder for workflow automation.
