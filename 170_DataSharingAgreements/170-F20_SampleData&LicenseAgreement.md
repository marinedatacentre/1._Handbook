4. OTHER
BC Electronic Library Network is a partnership between the Province of British Columbia and its post-
secondary libraries, including approved Associate Members and Yukon College.
BC ELN partners and members provide information services to their Authorized Users (faculty, students,
and staff) in the context of institutional appropriate use guidelines, onsite and from remote locations on
authentication that the individual is an Authorized User. BC ELN partners and members are eligible to
provide educational use for specified ICIS datasets on provision of a BCeID, ICIS ID, and dedicated
data librarian, who will provide an intermediary role in downloading data, providing technical advice, and
educating Users about Data Policies and Appropriate Use.
BC ELN coordinates communication with partner and member libraries and ICIS, including:
• developing a list of participating libraries with BCeIDs and data librarians for ICIS
• creating an internal listserv for communication with data librarians
• providing information about Data Policies and Appropriate Use
• coordinating training
Educational use includes use by faculty, students, and staff, for research and educational uses.
Examples of educational uses include development of applications for posting to public websites. Any
representation of the Data on a web site or on hard copy products to which any member of the public
may have access must be void of all attribute info, except for the CROWN_ADMIN attribute (information
on Crown land only), which may be displayed. Former students, faculty and staff will be able to retain
works developed while they were Authorized Users. For example, students will be able to continue to
post applications after graduation to show prospective employers.
Walk-in users (members of the public using the library onsite) will be able to view ICIS data on signing
the Appropriate Use Agreement.
Commercial use is not included. Inquiries about commercial uses will be referred to the ICIS data
provider.
