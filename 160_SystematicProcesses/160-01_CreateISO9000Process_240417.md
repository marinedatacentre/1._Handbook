<p>Check-in with Paulina to make sure a similar process does not already exist.</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><p>She’ll provide with a process number if the creation is approved.</p>
<p>Prior to starting, make sure to review the ISO-9000 Guide for PSF, as it will provide some background and necessary information on this process. You can find it <a href="https://pacificsalmonfoundation-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/psalinasruiz_psf_ca/EZmmuKp4kVtOtshAlBH2eM4BLjkjvlfm1lGn1iI4hgNBKA?e=K9bYQb">here</a>.</p></td>

<p>Copy the appropriate “ProcessTemplate” into it’s destination folder and rename it following this naming convention:</p>
<p>“Process#_TitleOfProcess_DateCreated (YYMMDD)”</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><p>Make sure to preserve the formatting of the original template, including font type and size.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to work on such template “in the app” rather than online, to preserve best possible formatting.</p></td>

<td><blockquote>
<p>Begin to describe the major activities of the process through the activity table. Try to be as thorough and concise as possible. If you need to link to a different process, ask Paulina for the link.</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td>If the process is a “form”, you do not need to include an activity table. Flowcharts and images are encouraged when appropriate.</td>
