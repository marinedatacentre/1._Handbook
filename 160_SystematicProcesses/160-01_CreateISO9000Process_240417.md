**Purpose:**



This document serves as a detailed guide to creating ISO 9000 processes as per the SGDC.



| **Step** | **Major Activity** | **References, Forms and Details** |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 1 | > Check-in with Paulina to make sure a similar process does not already exist. | She'll provide with a process number if the creation is approved. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Prior to starting, make sure to review the ISO-9000 Guide for PSF, as it will provide some background and necessary information on this process. You can find it [here](https://pacificsalmonfoundation-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/psalinasruiz_psf_ca/EZmmuKp4kVtOtshAlBH2eM4BLjkjvlfm1lGn1iI4hgNBKA?e=K9bYQb). |
| 2 | > Copy the appropriate "ProcessTemplate" into it's destination folder and rename it following this naming convention: | Make sure to preserve the formatting of the original template, including font type and size. |
|  | > |  |
|  | > "Process#\_TitleOfProcess_DateCreated (YYMMDD)" | Also, make sure to work on such template "in the app" rather than online, to preserve best possible formatting. |
| 3 | > Add the following information: |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | - Process number in the header |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | - Your name as the creator in the footer |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | - The date the process was created |  |
| 4 | Define purpose of the process | Usually, 1 sentence to 2 paragraphs long. Briefly describe purpose and any relevant information or background. |
| 5 | > Begin to describe the major activities of the process through the activity table. Try to be as thorough and concise as possible. If you need to link to a different process, ask Paulina for the link. | If the process is a "form", you do not need to include an activity table. Flowcharts and images are encouraged when appropriate. |
| 6 | > Once the process is finalized, save and share with Paulina for review and integration into the review system and appropriate Guide. |  |
