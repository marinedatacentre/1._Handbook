**[SGDC Annual Revisions]{.underline}**



I.  **ISO 9000 Process Revisions**



Revisions to the ISO 9000 processes are done during [January-February]{.mark} of each year.



To begin the process:



1.  Refer to the "[Process Metadata for Review](https://pacificsalmonfoundation-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/psalinasruiz_psf_ca/ESFI95z2Q9VEifi2iB0TP4oB9NBLaVPKsD1jDh3tMjcPeg?e=KTbW4o)" spreadsheet



2.  Filter the processes to show only those created by you.



3.  Review the "Date Created" of each process and revise all processes older than [3 years.]{.mark}



4.  To revise these processes:



    a.  [Copy]{.underline} the process to the "Archive" folder of its category.



    b.  Return to the original process and rename it to reflect the date in which you revise it.



    c.  Go through the process and provide any updates.



    d.  Once updates are completed, enter the revision date into "Date Last Revised" column of the "[Process Metadata for Review](https://pacificsalmonfoundation-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/psalinasruiz_psf_ca/ESFI95z2Q9VEifi2iB0TP4oB9NBLaVPKsD1jDh3tMjcPeg?e=KTbW4o)" spreadsheet.

II. **Metadata Record Revisions**



Revisions to the SGDC Metadata Records are done during [July -August]{.mark} of each year.



To begin the process:



1.  [(We need a step or 2 where we figure out how to assign who reviews which records, my guess is download that spreadsheet terry generated last time and assign a list of specific records to each team member)]{.mark}



2.  Once you have received the list of metadata records to review, follow the next steps:



    a.  Use your credentials to log into SGDC GeoNetwork



    b.  Navigate to the record you plan to revise and check for the following:



        i.  Thumbnail present and not broken or missing. If there is no thumbnail, assign a new one following this process: [110-0](https://pacificsalmonfoundation-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/psalinasruiz_psf_ca/EQdIk9uxw4dLhZiYUZNMFgkBGcktBKNOGNw0tCPr_BFmhg?e=2AAiAj)6 once you've reached step \# vii.



        ii. Title accurately describes what is included in the metadata record.



        iii. Record reflects current and accurate temporal and spatial extents.



        iv. The description is 1-2 paragraphs long and describes the project and/or materials included in the record.



        v.  Materials follow SGDC standards naming convention ([110-03](https://pacificsalmonfoundation-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/psalinasruiz_psf_ca/EdlYTBgfCqdKmNgEIY6JqQMBPIXGjcBLzHHX4_E26C1nHg?e=if2brE))



        vi. Navigate through each link or document to make sure they still work and are not outdated. If they are not, look for the appropriate resource. If, after an extensive search resource was not found, remove it.



        vii. Select "Edit" and conduct any necessary updates to bring the metadata record back to our standards.



        viii. Once you are finished, select "save and close" metadata record.



        ix. IMPORTANT: if you believe a record should no longer exist, let Paulina know and she will inform the appropriate team member. DO NOT delete any records.

III. **Interactive Product Revisions**



Revisions to the interactive maps and dashboards are done during [April-May]{.mark} of each year.



[\*\* Ben- we need to figure out how to do this, specially how to handle products that have been created by people no longer in our team\*\*]{.mark}



IV. **Non-Interactive Product Revisions**



Revisions to the non-interactive maps and dashboards are done during [October-November]{.mark} of each year.



[\*\* Ben- we need to figure out how to do this, specially how to handle products that have been created by people no longer in our team\*\*]{.mark} I assume this will be the easiest process as it'll just be making sure the products are good to stay on the website. I also think this will eventually include the data repository datasets so it will grow quickly.



V.  **Bibliography Revisions**



Conducted twice a year. Process to come.



VI. **Sitewide Revisions**



Sitewide Revisions are [done every two years?]{.mark}
