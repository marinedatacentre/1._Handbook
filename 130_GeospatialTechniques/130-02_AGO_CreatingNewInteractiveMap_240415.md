**Purpose:**

Create an interactive map in ArcGIS Online into which you can load layers for eventual display and use in a public-facing ArcGIS Online App.

Note – this process outlines steps best suited for adding Vector data (i.e. points, lines, polygons), while similar, the process for incorporating Raster data into maps is different.

<p>- Adding it from your <strong>My Content</strong> page</p>
<p>-Adding it from your <strong>My Organization</strong> content page</p>
<p>-Adding it from <strong>ArcGIS Online,</strong> which give the option to add from other organizations.</p></td>

<td>Select the <strong>Add</strong> button on the left side of the map viewer. Choose from several formats to add a layer that matches that criterion.</td>
<td>This method allows for quickly adding data to an AGO Interactive Map without having to add to your own Content. However, due to this, the layer exists in your organizational account only in this interactive map you are currently working on.</td>

<p>-<strong>Labels</strong> (allows you to add visual labels that appear on top of the features within the map)</p>
<p>-<strong>Clustering</strong> (when multiple features are close together within the map, they will appear grouped and expand when zoomed in)</p>
<p>-<strong>Filter</strong> (alter the layer so that only certain features appear based on an expression of your choosing)</p></td>
