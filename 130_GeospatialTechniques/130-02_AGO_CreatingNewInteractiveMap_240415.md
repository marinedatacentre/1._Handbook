**Purpose:**



Create an interactive map in ArcGIS Online into which you can load layers for eventual display and use in a public-facing ArcGIS Online App.



Note -- this process outlines steps best suited for adding Vector data (i.e. points, lines, polygons), while similar, the process for incorporating Raster data into maps is different.



| **Step** | **Major Activity** | **References, Forms and Details** |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 1 | Log into your assigned ArcGIS Online (AGO) organizational account. | A Username & Password are required |
| 2 | Click the **Map** button in the AGO header bar. | You may be prompted to choose between **Map Viewer** and **Map Viewer (Classic)**, this document outlines the default map viewer. |
| 3 | Select the **Save and Open** button on the left side of the map viewer. Save the map while entering contextual information for the CSV such as **Title**, **Tags,** and **Summary**. This information should be clear, concise, and understandable by all users. | It is good practice to save the map often. |
| 4 | Select the **Basemap** button on the left side of your screen to choose a new basemap if desired. |  |
| 5 -- option A | Select the **Layers** button on the left side of the map viewer. In the side panel that appears, choose to **Add layer**, find the one you are interested in, and **Add to map**. | There are various ways to add a layer. These include: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \- Adding it from your **My Content** page |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | -Adding it from your **My Organization** content page |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | -Adding it from **ArcGIS Online,** which give the option to add from other organizations. |
| 5 -- option B | Select the **Add** button on the left side of the map viewer. Choose from several formats to add a layer that matches that criterion. | This method allows for quickly adding data to an AGO Interactive Map without having to add to your own Content. However, due to this, the layer exists in your organizational account only in this interactive map you are currently working on. |
| 6 | Once the layer has been added, click the layer name in the **Layers** side panel to open that layer's **Properties** side panel on the right side of your screen. | -You can right-click the layer name to rename it |
| 7 | Configure the layers symbology as desired by clicking **Edit layer style**. | There are many options here for how to symbolize a dataset. Including: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | -symbolizing based on field |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | -showing as a heat map |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \- more minor but important steps such as setting transparency, determining layer symbol, changing the symbol size |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For more detailed information on layer symbolization, refer to the ESRI documentation available through their website and found via online search |
| 8 | Configure the layer pop-up as desired by clicking **Configure pop-ups** on the right side of your screen. | There are many options here for how to configure a pop-up. Including: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | -change the layer title as it displays in the pop-up |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | -remove certain fields from displaying in the pop-up |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | -add an image to your pop-up (e.g. the SoGDC logo with a link to the layer metadata in GeoNetwork) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For more detailed information on pop-up configuration, refer to the ESRI documentation available through their website and found via online search. |
| 9 | Perform any additional necessary actions for the layer using the buttons on the right side of your screen when the layer is selected. Possible actions include: |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | \-**Configure fields** (allows for re-naming of fields as they appear in the pop-up) |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | \-**Labels** (allows you to add visual labels that appear on top of the features within the map) |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | \-**Clustering** (when multiple features are close together within the map, they will appear grouped and expand when zoomed in) |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | \-**Filter** (alter the layer so that only certain features appear based on an expression of your choosing) |  |
| 10 | Add more layers as needed using step 5 and repeat steps 6 through 9. |  |
| 11 | The map is now ready to be linked to an ArcGIS Online Interactive App. |  |
