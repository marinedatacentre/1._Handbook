**Purpose:**

Create an interactive map in ArcGIS Online into which you can load
layers for eventual display and use in a public-facing ArcGIS Online
App.

Note -- this process outlines steps best suited for adding Vector data
(i.e. points, lines, polygons), while similar, the process for
incorporating Raster data into maps is different.
