**Purpose:**

- install geospatial applications on a suitable server,

- to connect the local server to the ICAN network

- to add metadata and data content,

- to periodically update the content

There are both open source and commercial applications which can be inter-combined to produce a desired solution. This is possible because there are extensive international standards governing every aspect of the solution. In fact, even open source solutions are often enhanced with commercial add-ons and consulting support.

To understand

- why one would have a knowledge management system,

- what are the metadata motivation and requirements,

- what are the requirements for a metadata catalogue service, and

- how to connect a local knowledge management system to the international network

refer to documents 300-F01, 300-F02, 300-F03 and 300-F04 respectively.
