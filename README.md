## Overview

The PSF Marine Data Centre Handbook is a living resource that documents the core workflows, tools, and structure of the Data Centre. 
It serves as a practical guide for new interns and team members, offering an overview of the software platforms we use, the front-end components of our system, and the key processes that support day-to-day operations. 
This handbook is intended to support onboarding, foster consistency, and make it easier for contributors to navigate and contribute to our work.
